\mainline{15.Bh2}?!
We have a typical Benoni structure. e5 is out of the question because the Black has overprotected the square. 
White should have played a5 to dampen Black's queen side play with b5. 

\mainline{15...Rac8 16.Bc4 Ne5 17.f4 Nxc4
18.Qxc4 Nd7 19.Rfe1 Qb6 20.Rab1 Qb4}

White could not exchange the queen because
\variation{21. Qxb4 cxb4 22. Nb1 Nc5} White loses a pawn.

\mainline{21.Qf1 c4 22.Re2}?

This move is too passive. White should have played some king side assault, according to the Benoni spirit: \variation{
    22. f5 Ne5 23. f6 Bf8 24. Bxe5 Rxe5 25. Qf2 h5 
} the position is almost equal. After the text move, Black is simply better.

\mainline{27.Qe1?}

Last blunder. White should still have played according to Benoni spirit with \variation{27. e5 Nc5 28. Rb1 Qxd5 29. Rd1 Nd3 30. Bg3 dxe5 31. fxe5 h5 32. Re3}. The position is still holdable. 


\mainline{27...c3
28.Rb1 Nc5} 

0-1

\chessboard

White resigns because there is no way to stop the c-pawn without losing material.
